      <p class="mt-4">
        At the opening of the exhibition on March 27, 2016 in the city of Kyiv,
        a Vedic prana-pratishtha ritual was performed over each of the 9 images
        - charging the form with divine energy (the ceremony was conducted by
        the priest Saishvararama (Olexandr Ukraintsev), Odesa). All the
        paintings, as well as those present at this sacrament, received a
        powerful charge of energy. <br /><br />
        The eternal and unchanging law of the universe (Sanatana Dharma) states
        that everything in the world is energy. All visible forms are just the
        interaction of the five types of energy. Prana is the energy of life
        that fills our being, every particle of space, life force, the power of
        the Creator who creates. Living paintings are canvases filled with the
        energy of life force. That is, each image created from the author's
        experience, depicted in the picture, consecrated with the help of a
        ritual, deeply interacts with the viewer, just as if one of the faces of
        the Lord appeared before him, for example, Shiva himself. <br /><br />
        The service of the image is a symbolic connection of the external and
        internal, so we are able to learn to show love and devotion, the highest
        human qualities embedded in us by the Creator in the image and likeness.
        Such examples of reviving images of the Lord exist in all religions that
        use a visible image. In the Christian tradition, they say that the icon
        is "praying".

            Shiva is the Destroyer of illusion, the personification of Cosmic
            Mercy. He brings liberation and renewal to the souls who have fallen
            under the power of Maya. Shambho means "The Magnanimous", "The Abode
            of Joy" or "Bringer of Happiness". Lord Shiva Shambho - “who
            promises you bliss”. This is friendly aspect of Shiva. This form
            cleanses the house of unfavorable subtle energies, calms the mind,
            expands consciousness and destroys egoism. Develops creative

            Shiva has always been called Triambaka because he has a third eye.
            This means that his perception has reached the highest possibility.
            The third eye is the eye of vision. The two physical eyes are simply
            sense organs. What we call Shiva is nothing but the very embodiment
            of the highest perception. Yoga is not a religion, it is the science
            of inner evolution.

            physical existence, you felt the desire to go beyond the physical,
            you felt that even this boundless cosmos limits you. Yoga means
            transcending the barriers of physical existence. Your efforts are
            aimed not only at subjugating the physical aspect of existence, but
            also at destroying its boundaries and touching a dimension that is
            not physical in nature. You want to combine the limited with the
            unlimited. You want to dissolve limitations into the limitless
            nature of existence. <br />And the form of Shiva Yogeshvara helps on

          <h3 class="text-center">canvas, oil, 2015, 70x70 cm</h3>
          <p class="mt-3">
            Shiva is consciousness, a stable principle, eternal and unchanging.
            Shakti is transformation, time, change. Thanks to Shakti, Shiva's
            consciousness can manifest itself in reality, take form. Shakti
            energy which drives the world. This energy is everywhere, it is
            prana. Shiva is superconscious, Shakti is prana, energy. Shakti is
            the building material of which the universe is built, but also the
            great illusion called Maya in which we live. Form is Emptiness.
            Emptiness is form... Shiva continues to dance the Tandava, causing
            the world to continue to develop until one day he stops, which will
            put an end to this world in order to give life to a new one. Shiva,
            performing his dance, connects with his wife Shakti and re-creates
            the world. A person needs both components - Consciousness (Shiva)
            and Energy (Shakti). "Shiva without Shakti is a shava (corpse)." And
            Shakti without Shiva is an insane, uncentered force, often
            self-destructive. Only when Shiva and Shakti merge, action, movement
            and creation become possible. This dance is about it. Think about
            this...

          <h3 class="text-center">canvas, oil, 2021, 40x40 cm</h3>
          <p class="mt-3">
            I draw yantras to order. The request is agreed with what to work
            with, colors, framing, size. Execution - oil, acryle, fluorescent
            paints is possible. The very geometric design of the yantra is
            created in such a way that it transfers the brain to a certain alpha
            rhythm. For example, focusing on the yantra of the goddess Lakshmi
            (with a frequency of 8 to 14 hertz, which corresponds to a
            meditative state) contributes to the activation of the right
            hemisphere of the brain and leads to the emergence of creative
            insights and sharpening of intuition. This picture depicts Sri
            Yantra.
